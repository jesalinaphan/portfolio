									<h1>Hi! <br>
                                        I'm Jesalina Phan</h1>
									<p>I created this portfolio to document several of the projects that I have recently done, but I don't think it actually encapsulates much about me, so let me tell you!</p>

								<div class="image profile"><img src="images/SA photo.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p> Growing up in Portsmouth, NH, I have always been a lover of downhill skiing, the rushing ocean, and drives through the woods in the fall when the colors of the leaves melt in the morning dew. From a young age, I played the violin and that became my life's passion (and sometimes terror) from 5 years old into my highschool years. I performed in Carnegie Hall and joined the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra which brought me on wonderous tours throughout the world, including Greece and South Africa (pictured above). I learned the power of confidence and collaboration which can create something that moves people to tears.</p>
								<p>While I believed for a long time that my childhood was defined by music, I now see that I loved so much more than that. I loved constructing the sturdiest gingerbread house and building Legos without the instructions. I loved DIYing any piece of clothing that didn't fit me well enough, fixing my mom's necklace every time it broke, and Saturdays when my dad and I would go to the Home Depot to construct bird houses together. In highschool, I jumped on projects that combined building with helping my community. I was passionate about engineering and design because through my projects, I felt like I could create something that was bigger than myself, something that could benefit others. Whether it be by busking downtown to raise money for orphanages in Vietnam, spending time volunteering at a food pantry, or building the newest prosthetic limb, I want to positively impact those around me and maybe even light a spark in them to do the same. <br/>
                                    <br/>
                                    And more than any of the projects I've linked, <b>that is what encapsulates me.<b\></p>
